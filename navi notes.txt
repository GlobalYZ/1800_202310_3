map current functions:
Zoom in & Zoom out
Map asks for accessing to user's current location. If the user declined, the map will set to the default address: BCIT school
Maker points to primary location
navigation route map
combined with google api, data transfer between address and latitude&lontitude


to do:
-after the structure of database is done and all data needed is clear:
Organize icon images for differenct road condition markers
Add event listeners on the icon makers of road conditions, write popup messages.
Hide and show icon markers (customize settings)

Map Limitations:
can not recalculate route, only one route available
can not generate public transit route

We need to decide:
Road Condition types

 Todo List:
road condition list add city filter and switch button(road condition list and alert list)
add address in the road condition list card  
alert list add switch button
alert list (road condition card with address and weather alert with timestamp)
customize map markers visibility in the contribution history and the popup message visbility with form elements [type1, type2, type3â€¦](please refer to the type options in the report page)

logout in the userprofile
delete account in the userprofile                                                                                                                                  
contributionHistory page needs to include an edit function (title and description pop up - edit + save get data from firebase first and then edit on top of the data)
reportDetailsPage need to add post under users
each time report is submitted needs to go to two databases: roadConditionList and Users
need to use key values from Discord

map add a weather icon on top right corner 
map markers connected with firebase, popup message when user click each marker, user click popup message jumps to detail page
delete function on the user profile for the post
pop up message (setTimeout) on the map page
